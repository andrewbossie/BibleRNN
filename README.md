# BibleRNN
(Work in Progress)

## Description
BibleRNN is a charater generating neural network. The input data for this algorithm is the King James Version of the Holy Bible
The output is a verse of the bible completely generated by the neural network. This neural network can in theory be extended to work with any volume of text. 

## Dependancies
*Python
*Numpy
*Pandas
*Tensorflow-GPU
*Keras
*Anaconda (Optional)

## Running
Append your path/to/bible/passage into the file variable of biblernn.py.__
Run: `python biblernn.py `
